# Classical Mechanics Tutorials

This is a repository to house the animations made for this series on classical mechanics. Feel free to add to this README!

## Rendering with manim

In order to render one of the python files in high quality, use

`manim -qh <file.py> <scene name>`

The scene is the class in the file which extends the manim `Scene` class. Previously rendered animations are stored in the media folder
